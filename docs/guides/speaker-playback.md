# Speaker Playback

Supported panels expose an ESPHome media player named after the panel with
“Speaker” appended. Home Assistant can send announcements and media to it,
control playback, and adjust its volume. The board amplifier turns on during
playback and switches off when playback ends.

Use **Browse media** on the speaker entity in Home Assistant to choose audio
from the Home Assistant media browser, including sources provided by installed
integrations such as Music Assistant. Home Assistant resolves the selected
item and sends its audio stream to the speaker; the device does not need a
separate account or connection to each music service.

The speaker also connects to Music Assistant as a native Sendspin player. It is
discovered automatically when Music Assistant and the panel are on the same
network; no separate Music Assistant player provider setup is required.

Connect a compatible passive speaker to the panel's speaker connector. The P4
audio output uses the onboard ES8311 codec and amplifier; no external DAC is
needed.

## S3 4848S040

The 4848S040 uses its relay GPIOs for the onboard I2S amplifier, so this setup
keeps the relays available and uses an external I2S amplifier instead. Connect
the external amplifier's BCLK to GPIO41 and LRCLK to GPIO42. Connect the
panel's DOUT on GPIO43 to the amplifier's DIN input, then connect power and
ground as required by the amplifier. Connect a speaker to the amplifier output.

GPIO43 is shared with UART0 transmit, so serial log output is disabled on this
profile when speaker playback is enabled.

The onboard amplifier path requires hardware changes and reassigning the relay
GPIOs. The default firmware does not make that change.

Audio uses ESPHome's speaker media player, which requires ESP-IDF and Home
Assistant 2024.10 or newer for Home Assistant media transcoding.
